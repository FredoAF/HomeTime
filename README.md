# Description
This simple taskbar application counts down 8 hours (7.5 working hours plus 30 mins lunch) before alerting the user with a pop-up that their working day is over.
I created this when working flexi hours and forgetting what time I'd actually turned my laptop on. Its also useful to remind me what time I should log overtime.
